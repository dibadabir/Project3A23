Well, I think going forward, one of our co founders had this quote where the programming language of the future is gonna be English or gonna be language. If it's English for me or it's Korean for someone else, that you can actually just use language to interact with computers. And so I think it's more thinking about what is the problem you wanna solve. What is the what is the value that solving this problem will create and then how to use these tools, these applications that are being developed by companies like ours working with companies like yours to then do the higher order up leveling to to solve even bigger and better problems. Well, Martin Dario, thank you both so much for being with us. I'm so excited about partnering with both of your companies.\",\n",
